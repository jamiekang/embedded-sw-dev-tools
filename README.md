# embedded-sw-dev-tools
The purpose of this project is to illustrate a suite of embedded software development tools for an imaginary DSP processor.
This project contains an instruction-level simulator (dspsim), a binary simulator (binsim), a linker (dsplnk), and assembly code examples. 
I have defined the processor's instruction set architecture and have written all software development tools and applications for 4G wireless services (not included).
- dspsim: an instruction-level simulator that can also function as an assembler
- binsim: a binary simulator
- dsplnk: a linker
- examples: code examples such as FFT, multiplication, and so on.
